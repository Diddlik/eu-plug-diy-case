# Introduction

There has been an increasing number of DIY devices appearing on the Internet over the last few years. Most of the time, the main issue with the interior of the house is the ease of use of the system. In order to connect the device, you will need a USB cable, a power supply, or another variation of that.

As long as it is hidden behind a cabinet or in a place that is unsightly, it is fine, but when it has to be placed somewhere visible, it becomes more challenging.

As for smart home devices, I am actively using devices from [modkam.ru](https://modkam.ru/2022/12/14/presence_sensor/), [Espresence](https://espresense.com/), and [nuki-hub](https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub) within my smart home. Thus, it was decided to make a universal enclosure for all of these devices that could be used in a standard euro socket.

# Assembly

To assemble the enclosure we need an EU adapter.

From there, we pull out the pins and pinch the pins.   

Next, we heat the nut and press it into the adapter.
